# What it does:
Allows for control the states of Shelly Cloud products as home assistant sensors with the following features:

* Sensor System
* Sensor Wifi
* Sensor Mqtt
* Sensor Cloud
* Sensor Firmware
* MQTT Cover

# Configuration
### Download python files
Reproduce the directory structure of the [master branch](https://github.com/marcogazzola/custom_components) in your config directory custom_components directory to create the folder `shelly_cloud`. Currently it should look like:
```
custom_components
  shelly_cloud
    __init__.py
    const.py
    sensor.py
    cover.py
    shelly_data.py
```
### Configure HA
Once there youâ€™ll need to **update your config** to include the following platform in **configuration.yaml**:

##### MQTT Cover will be created automatically only if shelly works in Roller Shutter mode and it is connetted via MQTT

```yaml
shelly_cloud:
  devices:
    - ip_address: !secret shelly_ip_address
```

***Configuration Variables***
Each **device** in **devices** may have the following settings:

```
ip_address
  (string)(Required)The IP address or hostname of the Shelly you want to track.

scan_interval
  (time)(Optional)Minimum time interval between updates. Supported formats: scan_interval: 'HH:MM:SS', scan_interval: 'HH:MM' and Time period dictionary (see example below).
  Default value: 2 minutes

monitored_conditions
  (list)(Optional)Sensors to display in the frontend.
  Default value: All keys
  
  system
    will be created sensor that will expose system informations like mac address, working mode, model name, etc..

  wifi
    will be created sensor that will expose wifi informations like wifi quality (%), ip address, SSID

  mqtt
